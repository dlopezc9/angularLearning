All the small projects that I have done in angular. Take a look at my journey!

Important!
Next is listed the order of the projects, so must likely they get better as you get further into the list.

1. BookApi: can also be taken as a hello world.
2. EmployeeManagement: first approach to good practices, and simple solution to multiple components.
3. StampCollection: first approach without any tutorial! (In progress).
